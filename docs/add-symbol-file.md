# add-symbol-file notes

Okay so the idea is that we craft a minimal ELF file that contains a bunch of symbols that we want to add to a given binary, and then use the GDB `add-symbol-file` command.

## Debugging

I use this: https://github.com/horsicq/XELFViewer . I have added the binary to PATH and named it `elfview`.

GDB has these settings:
```
set debug symtab-create 1000
set debug symfile on
set debug symbol-lookup on
```
but they are franky useless.

## Issues

While the decompiler symbol syncing works quite well, the kernel is giving lots of trouble. For the decompiler syncing, I don't even have to pass an address to `add-symbol-file`. The absolute addresses are hardcoded into the ELF anyway (the same is true for bata), so it just works™.

I have seen two weird behaviours:

### Wrong address

I problem I've encountered is that `ks commit_creds` shows one address, but after `ks --apply`, `print commit_creds` shows another one. For instance:
```
pwndbg> ks commit_creds
0xffffffff81110ca0 T commit_creds
0xffffffff81fc0efc t commit_creds.cold
pwndbg> p commit_creds
❌️ Cannot access memory at address 0xffffffff02110ca0
```
I checked that in fact, inside the ELF file the address (the value field in the symtab entry) is 0xffffffff81110ca0, so I don't know what is going on. Is it a GDB bug? It happens regardless of the type of the symbol (COMMON vs FUNCTION). In both cases I set the type to GLOBAL (surely this is not the issue).

This problem happens when I **do** pass in the kernel .text address (`0xffffffff81000000` with ASLR off) to `add-symbol-file`. It works correctly when I don't do that. Note that I observe the same behaviour regardless of if my ELF e_type is EXEC or REL.

Ou, I found the issue! `0xffffffff81000000 + 0xffffffff81110ca0 = 0x1ffffffff02110ca0`.

But, accoring to the "Symbol Values" section of https://refspecs.linuxbase.org/elf/elf.pdf . When the ELF is an executable (and shared object file), the st_value field describes a virtual address and not a section offset. I have this issue even when I set `e_type` to EXEC (is that a GDB bug?).

Note that my sh_addr is 0 for .text, but bata uses the correct VMA.

Okay it seems GDB performs this calculation to determine a symbol's address: `ADDR + (st_value - sh_addr)` where `ADDR`is the address passed to the `add-symbol-file` command, `st-value` the symbol address specified in the symtab entry, and `sh_addr` the address specified in the section header table for the `.text` section entry. For example, when I set `sh_addr` of `.text` to `4` and do `p commit_creds` I get `0xffffffff02110c9c`.

When you don't pass in the `ADDR` the `sh_addr` doesn't matter, and a symbol's address is calculated as just `st_value`. :S

So all in all, the safe bet is in fact setting `sh_addr` (because it is required if you want `ADDR` to work, and doesn't do anything if you don't pass `ADDR` in).

### Examine doesn't work

The second issue, is that even if `ks` and `print` show the same address, examining with `x/20i mysym` doesn't show the symbol. Similarly, it doesn't get populated properly in the context disassembly. This works in bata's method and it also works for me in the decompilation view.

```
pwndbg> p commit_creds
$2 = {<text variable, no debug info>} 0xffffffff81110ca0
pwndbg> x/20i commit_creds
   0xffffffff81110ca0:	nop    DWORD PTR [rax+rax*1+0x0]
   0xffffffff81110ca5:	push   r13
   0xffffffff81110ca7:	mov    r13,QWORD PTR gs:0x20bc0
   0xffffffff81110cb0:	push   r12
   0xffffffff81110cb2:	push   rbp
```

This is probably a good sanity test. bata:
```
gef> info symbol commit_creds+0x10
commit_creds + 16 in section .text
```
Us:
```
pwndbg> info symbol commit_creds+0x10
No symbol matches commit_creds+0x10.
```

The root cause of this issue is the same as [[#Offsets not shown in the context]].

### Offsets not shown in the context

This happens even in the decompilation workflow. The problem is simply that the output looks like this:
```
0x555555555060 <start>    endbr64         [...]
0x555555555064 <start>    xor    ebp, ebp [...]
0x555555555066 <start>    mov    r9, rdx  [...]
0x555555555069 <start>    pop    rsi      [...]
```
whereas I would expect `<start>`, `<start+4>`, `<start+6>`...

The root cause of this issue is the same as [[#Examine doesn't work]]. bata24 explained to me that for this to work, I have to set up the sh_size of the `.text` section (he has code for this in gef.py:create_blank_elf()). And indeed, doing that fixes the issue fully.

For GDB to not throw a warning on `add-symbol-file` though, I have to make `.text` a NOBITS section (which makes sense to do anyway).

### e_machine and architecture mismatch

The ELF file format specifies two interesting fields in the ELF header. `e_machine` which specifies the CPU architecture and `e_ident[EI_CLASS]` which specifies a 32 or 64-bit ELF file. I think `e_ident[EI_CLASS]` does not actually have to be the same as the target CPU architecture, but I can easily emit both so it's better safe than sorry.

However, when I use qemu-user to debug an aarch32 binary and make an aarch32 file with 32-bit EI_CLASS, GDB complains. I am on an x86_64 machine and my setup is:
```bash
zig cc main.c --target=arm-linux-musleabi -o mainarm -static
llvm-strip mainarm
qemu-arm -g 1234 mainarm

gdb mainarm
gdb> tar rem :1234
gdb> add-symbol-file /tmp/symbols-qhfb5a4a.elf 0xwhatever
error: `/tmp/symbols-qhfb5a4a.elf': can't read symbols: file format not recognized.
# very useful GDB, thank you.
```
And in fact, when I use `e_machine` for x86_64 and emit an ELFCLASS64 ELF, it works perfectly! What!!

I try to emit the correct target `e_machine` field by asking for the debugee CPU architecture from pwndbg, converting it to a zig CPU architecture, and then converting that to an ELF `e_machine` (looked at zig source). I can confirm that I'm emitting that field correctly using `elfview`. It is possible, maybe, that the x86_64 ELF-parsing GDB backend is forgiving to my barebones ELF, while the aarch32 one isn't? Seems very unlikely though.

From what I can tell, I always get "file format not recognized" when trying to emit ELFCLASS32. Maybe I have some bug in there with crafting those ELFs. 

When I was using EI_CLASS pointing to 64-bit ELF, but trying out some random e_machine values, I had the following issues:

+ The symbols get resolved to 32-bit addresses (the st_value gets cut off).
+ I can set a breakpoint on a symbol but execution does not actually stop there
+ SIGILL gets triggered during execution (possibly related to the line above?)

mahaloz pointed out that GDB likes it when you pass in the ELF for the host machine, rather than the target, which is wild. But truly, both him and bata use gcc to create a blank ELF that is valid for the current host. I tested using x86_64 + ELFCLASS64 for:
1. Debugging x86_64 binary on x86_64 host.
2. Debugging aarch32 binary on x86_64 host.
3. Debugging aarch64 binary on aarch64 host.

And it all seems to work. So for now I am pinning the ELF to be x86_64 + ELFCLASS64 until we encounter an actual issue.


## Bata's code is weird

He actually passes an address to `add-symbol-file`. I see no actual benefit to doing this.

Also he keeps .data and .bss but none of the symbols reference them.

## Design choices

### Passing an address

The usage of the `add-symbol-file` command is (GDB 18.0):
```
Usage: add-symbol-file FILE [-readnow|-readnever] [-o OFF] [ADDR] [-s SECT-NAME SECT-ADDR]...
```
but it seems for older versions of GDB (8.x) (re: bata, VmlinuxToElfApplyCommand), the `ADDR` was mandatory.

The `ADDR` is supposed to represent the Virtual Memory Address (VMA) of the `.text` section of the ELF file we are adding. Note that the actual sections of the objfile we are trying to symbolicate don't really matter.

There are a few weird things to mention here. Firstly, there shouldn't be a need/benefit to pass this address because all of our symbol addresses are hardcoded in the ELF file anyway.

Secondly, bata and decomp2dbg always pass in this address.

Thirdly, decomp2dbg actually intentionally leaves in a `.bss` section in the binary, but no symbols actually reference it (they only reference `.text`).

Neither of them really use the `-s` flag with the `add-symbol-file` command (bata, VmlinuxToElfApplyCommand is an exception, but thats because the file we are adding only has a `.kernel` section).

Interestingly, when I DON'T pass an address I don't have the [[#Wrong address]] issue.

Passing in an address also isn't necessary for the [[#Examine doesn't work]] [[#Offsets not shown in the context]] fix.

### ELF type

An ELF file can be one of a few types (determined by the e_type field in the ELF header), namely: REL, EXEC, DYN, and CORE. The LIEF way to craft the file emits an EXEC. Bata also emits an EXEC. I think it doesn't matter because I don't see any noticable difference in behaviour when I try to play around with it.
