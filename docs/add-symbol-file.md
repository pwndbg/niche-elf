# add-symbol-file notes

Okay so the idea is that we craft a minimal ELF file that contains a bunch of symbols that we want to add to a given binary, and then use the GDB `add-symbol-file` command.

## Debugging

I use this: https://github.com/horsicq/XELFViewer . I have added the binary to PATH and named it `elfview`.

## Issues

While the decompiler symbol syncing works quite well, the kernel is giving lots of trouble. For the decompiler syncing, I don't even have to pass an address to `add-symbol-file`. The absolute addresses are hardcoded into the ELF anyway (the same is true for bata), so it just works™.

I have seen two weird behaviours:

### Wrong address

I problem I've encountered is that `ks commit_creds` shows one address, but after `ks --apply`, `print commit_creds` shows another one. For instance:
```
pwndbg> ks commit_creds
0xffffffff81110ca0 T commit_creds
0xffffffff81fc0efc t commit_creds.cold
pwndbg> p commit_creds
❌️ Cannot access memory at address 0xffffffff02110ca0
```
I checked that in fact, inside the ELF file the address (the value field in the symtab entry) is 0xffffffff81110ca0, so I don't know what is going on. Is it a GDB bug? It happens regardless of the type of the symbol (COMMON vs FUNCTION). In both cases I set the type to GLOBAL (surely this is not the issue).

This problem happens when I **do** pass in the kernel .text address (`0xffffffff81000000` with ASLR off) to `add-symbol-file`. It works correctly when I don't do that. Note that I observe the same behaviour regardless of if my ELF e_type is EXEC or REL.

Ou, I found the issue! `0xffffffff81000000 + 0xffffffff81110ca0 = 0x1ffffffff02110ca0`.

But, accoring to the "Symbol Values" section of https://refspecs.linuxbase.org/elf/elf.pdf . When the ELF is an executable (and shared object file), the st_value field describes a virtual address and not a section offset. I have this issue even when I set `e_type` to EXEC (is that a GDB bug?).

Note that my sh_addr is 0 for .text, but bata uses the correct VMA.

Okay it seems GDB performs this calculation to determine a symbol's address: `ADDR + (st_value - sh_addr)` where `ADDR`is the address passed to the `add-symbol-file` command, `st-value` the symbol address specified in the symtab entry, and `sh_addr` the address specified in the section header table for the `.text` section entry. For example, when I set `sh_addr` of `.text` to `4` and do `p commit_creds` I get `0xffffffff02110c9c`.

When you don't pass in the `ADDR` the `sh_addr` doesn't matter, and a symbol's address is calculated as just `st_value`. :S

So all in all, the safe bet is in fact setting `sh_addr` (because it is required if you want `ADDR` to work, and doesn't do anything if you don't pass `ADDR` in).

### Examine doesn't work

The second issue, is that even if `ks` and `print` show the same address, examining with `x/20i mysym` doesn't show the symbol. Similarly, it doesn't get populated properly in the context disassembly. This works in bata's method and it also works for me in the decompilation view.

```
pwndbg> p commit_creds
$2 = {<text variable, no debug info>} 0xffffffff81110ca0
pwndbg> x/20i commit_creds
   0xffffffff81110ca0:	nop    DWORD PTR [rax+rax*1+0x0]
   0xffffffff81110ca5:	push   r13
   0xffffffff81110ca7:	mov    r13,QWORD PTR gs:0x20bc0
   0xffffffff81110cb0:	push   r12
   0xffffffff81110cb2:	push   rbp
```

### Offsets not shown when examining

This happens even in the decompilation workflow. The problem is simply that the output looks like this:
```
0x555555555060 <start>    endbr64         [...]
0x555555555064 <start>    xor    ebp, ebp [...]
0x555555555066 <start>    mov    r9, rdx  [...]
0x555555555069 <start>    pop    rsi      [...]
```
whereas I would expect `<start>`, `<start+4>`, `<start+6>`...


## Bata is weird

One thing that I find weird is that he chooses a relative ELF.

Another thing is that he actually passes an address to `add-symbol-file`.

## Design choices

### Passing an address

The usage of the `add-symbol-file` command is (GDB 18.0):
```
Usage: add-symbol-file FILE [-readnow|-readnever] [-o OFF] [ADDR] [-s SECT-NAME SECT-ADDR]...
```
but it seems for older versions of GDB (8.x) (re: bata, VmlinuxToElfApplyCommand), the `ADDR` was mandatory.

The `ADDR` is supposed to represent the Virtual Memory Address (VMA) of the `.text` section of the ELF file we are adding. Note that the actual sections of the objfile we are trying to symbolicate don't really matter.

There are a few weird things to mention here. Firstly, there shouldn't be a need/benefit to pass this address because all of our symbol addresses are hardcoded in the ELF file anyway.

Secondly, bata and decomp2dbg always pass in this address.

Thirdly, decomp2dbg actually intentionally leaves in a `.bss` section in the binary, but no symbols actually reference it (they only reference `.text`).

Neither of them really use the `-s` flag with the `add-symbol-file` command (bata, VmlinuxToElfApplyCommand is an exception, but thats because the file we are adding only has a `.kernel` section).

Interestingly, when I DON'T pass an address I don't have the [[#Wrong address]] issue.

### ELF type

An ELF file can be one of a few types (determined by the e_type field in the ELF header), namely: REL, EXEC, DYN, and CORE. The LIEF way to craft the file emits an EXEC. Bata also emits an EXEC. I think it doesn't matter because I don't see any noticable difference in behaviour when I try to play around with it.
